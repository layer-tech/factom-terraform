# Factom Nodes Ansible

This project provisions servers that were created by the terraform project.

# Requirements

* Python 3.6.5
* Ansible-playbook 2.5.3

# Setup

Collect the IP addresses you will need for the inventory files. You can find
these on the report generated by Terraform, or from the cloud dashboard. h

The IP addresses you need are:

* 2 IP addresses for the authority nodes
* 2 IP addresses for the guard nodes
* 1 IP address for the monitoring node

Use these for the appropriate inventory file you find in the `inventory` directory.

# Provision Order

First start by provisioning the guard nodes:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/guard guard_node.yml

Then start the authority nodes:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/authority auth_node.yml

Finally, get monitoring running

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/monitoring monitoring.yml
